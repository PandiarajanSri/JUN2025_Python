'''1. Get input for variable name and age. Print it'''
# a = input("Enter your name : ")
# b = int(input("Enter your age : "))
# print("Your name is ",a)
# print("Your age is ",b)

'''2. Get input  for variable name,age,address. Print it'''

# a = input("Enter your name: ")
# b = input("Enter your age: ")
# c = input("Enter your address: ")
# print("Your name is :",a)
# print("Your age is :",b)
# print("Your Address is :",c)

'''3. Get integer input for variable a,b,c
Multiply all 3 variables (a*b*c)
add all variable (a+b+c)
Divide the multiplied value by added values
print it'''

# a = int(input("Enter the value for a : "))
# b = int(input("Enter the value for b : "))
# c = int(input("Enter the value for c : "))
#
# d = a*b*c
# e = a+b+c
#
# f = d/e
#
# print(type(f))

'''While Loop

Syntax :
while some_bollean_condition:
    #do something
else:
    #do something different'''

# x = 0
#
# while x < 5:
#     print("The current value of X is :",x)
#     x = x + 1
#
# else:
#     print("End of the code")

'''3 common words used in loop
break - Breaks out of the current closed enclosing loop
continue - Goes to the top of the closest enclosing loop
pass - Does nothing at all '''

#pass
# x = [1,2,3]
